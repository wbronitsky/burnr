Welcome to burnr

This is a simple, anonymous chat application I made using WebRTC and PeerJS.

It makes a peer to peer connection with someone based upon a chat name. Just create one, and tell your friend the name and they can connect to you.

Nothing is saved, and everything is destroyed when you click burn.

All chats are encrypted using public key encryption.

Feel free to start over once you burn your chat. 

Enjoy.

Note: Only works in latest updates of Firefox and Chrome.
